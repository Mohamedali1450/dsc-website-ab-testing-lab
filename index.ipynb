    "\n",
    "1. **Chi-square Test:**\n",
    "   - Initial chi-square test showed a p-value of 0.0565, indicating no significant difference between groups.\n",
    "   - Decision: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proportions Z-test:**\n",
    "   - Proportions z-test revealed a p-value of 0.0088, suggesting a significant difference.\n",
    "   - Decision: Reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binomial Distribution & Z-score Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Expected clicks for the experiment group were around 857.68.\n",
    "   - The observed z-score was approximately 2.72.\n",
    "   - Calculated p-value from the z-score was 0.0066.\n",
    "   - Consistent with the proportions z-test, indicating statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistent low p-values across different analyses suggest a meaningful improvement in user engagement with the experimental homepage. The experimental group, on average, exhibited a significantly higher click-through rate compared to the control group. This implies that the changes made to the homepage were effective in encouraging user clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while statistical significance was observed, practical significance should also be considered. The improvements should align with the goals and objectives of the music app.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Conclusion:***\n",
    "The experimental homepage was found to be more effective than the control homepage, leading to a higher click-through rate. The evidence supports implementing the changes introduced in the experimental design.\n",

Additionally, you also saw how to verify results, strengthening your knowledge of binomial variables, and reviewing initial statistical concepts of the central limit theorem, standard deviation, z-scores, and their accompanying p-values."
